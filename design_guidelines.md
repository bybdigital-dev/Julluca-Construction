# Design Guidelines for Julluca Construction Website

## Design Approach
**Industry-Specific Reference Approach**: Drawing from successful contractor/home services websites with emphasis on trust-building, project showcasing, and easy contact methods. The design should convey sturdiness, reliability, and outdoor/earthy professionalism.
